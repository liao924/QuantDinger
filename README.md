## Overview

QuantDinger is a self-hosted quantitative trading workspace that brings together AI-assisted market analysis, Python strategy development, backtesting, live execution, portfolio operations, and billing-ready user management in one deployable stack.

The current `v3.0.1` release aligns frontend/runtime versioning, refreshes the public documentation, and refines UI consistency on top of the recent strategy backtesting upgrades already documented in `docs/CHANGELOG.md`.

## Why QuantDinger

- **Self-hosted by design**: you control deployment, credentials, strategy code, and operational data.
- **Research to execution in one product**: market data, AI analysis, indicator/strategy authoring, backtests, and live trading are connected.
- **Python-native workflow**: generate strategies with AI or write them directly with the Python ecosystem you already know.
- **Operator-ready architecture**: Docker Compose, PostgreSQL, Redis, Nginx, health checks, and environment-driven configuration.
- **Commercialization support**: built-in membership plans, credits, USDT payment flows, and admin controls.

## v3.0.1 Highlights

- Frontend versioning, footer display, and release documentation are aligned to `3.0.1`.
- Repository-level README content is rewritten to better match the actual deployment model and product scope.
- Exchange signup/referral links are now documented consistently with the in-app "Open account" entry.
- Backtest Center UI polish continues the recent strategy-backtest productization work introduced in earlier `2.2.x` releases.

## Open Source Repositories

To make the project easier to navigate, the current public repositories are:

| Repository | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| [QuantDinger](https://github.com/brokermr810/QuantDinger) | Main repository: backend, deployment stack, docs, prebuilt frontend delivery |

## Quick Start

> Requirement: install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). Node.js is not required for deployment because this repository already includes the prebuilt frontend in `frontend/dist`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/brokermr810/QuantDinger.git
cd QuantDinger
cp backend_api_python/env.example backend_api_python/.env
./scripts/generate-secret-key.sh
docker-compose up -d --build
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/brokermr810/QuantDinger.git
cd QuantDinger
Copy-Item backend_api_python\env.example -Destination backend_api_python\.env
$key = py -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"
(Get-Content backend_api_python\.env) -replace '^SECRET_KEY=.*$', "SECRET_KEY=$key" | Set-Content backend_api_python\.env -Encoding UTF8
docker-compose up -d --build
```

After startup:

- Frontend: `http://localhost:8888`
- Backend health check: `http://localhost:5000/api/health`
- Default login: `quantdinger` / `123456`

Important deployment notes:

- The backend container will **not start** if `SECRET_KEY` still uses the default value.
- The main application config lives in `backend_api_python/.env`.
- Root `.env` is optional and is mainly used for image mirrors or custom ports.
- Default Docker stack includes `frontend` + `backend` + `postgres` + `redis`.

### Common Docker Commands

```bash
docker-compose ps
docker-compose logs -f backend
docker-compose restart backend
docker-compose up -d --build
docker-compose down
```

### Optional Root `.env`

If you need custom ports or image mirrors, create a root `.env`:

```ini
FRONTEND_PORT=3000
BACKEND_PORT=127.0.0.1:5001
IMAGE_PREFIX=docker.m.daocloud.io/library/
```
